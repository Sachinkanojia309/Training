------------------------------------------------------------Ruby Syntax-----------------------------------------------------------------

 1). All ruby files will have extension .rb
 
 2). To print the output in ruby :-
 
 	a. puts "Hello, Ruby!";        # it will provide new line by default.
 	b. print "Hello, Ruby!";       # semicolon is not mendatory.
 	
 3). Whitespace in Ruby Program :-
 	-> Whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs are generally ignored in Ruby code, except when they appear in strings.
 	
 	eg :-   a + b is interpreted as a+b ( Here a is a local variable)
		a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) ( Here a is a method call)
		
 4). Ruby Identifiers :-
       -> Identifiers are names of variables, constants, and methods. Ruby identifiers are case sensitive. 
       -> It means Ram and RAM are two different identifiers in Ruby.
       
 5). Reserved Words :-
       -> The following list shows the reserved words in Ruby. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable names. 
       -> They can, however, be used as method names.

	BEGIN		do	next	then
	END		else	nil	true
	alias		elsif	not	undef
	and		end	or	unless
	begin		ensure	redo	until
	break		false	rescue	when
	case		for	retry	while
	class		if	return	while
	def		in	self	__FILE__
	defined?	module	super	__LINE__
       
 6). Here Document in Ruby :-
 
	-> "Here Document" refers to build strings from multiple lines. 
	-> Following a << you can specify a string or an identifier to terminate the string literal, and all lines following the current line up to the terminator are the value of the string.

	-> If the terminator is quoted, the type of quotes determines the type of the line-oriented string literal. 
	-> Notice there must be no space between << and the terminator.
       
        eg :- a). print <<EOF
		   This is the first way of creating
		   here document ie. multiple line string.
		  EOF

	      b). print <<"EOF";                # same as above
		   This is the second way of creating
		   here document ie. multiple line string.
		  EOF

	      c). print <<`EOC`                 # execute commands
			echo hi there
			echo lo there
		  EOC

	      d). print <<"foo", <<"bar"  # you can stack them
			I said foo.
		  foo
			I said bar.
		  bar
		  
 7). Ruby BEGIN Statement :- Declares code to be called before the program is run.
	
	Syntax :- 
		BEGIN {
	   	   code
		}
	
	eg :- 
	code :-   puts "main code"
		  BEGIN{
		     puts "priority code"
		  }

	output :- priority code
		  main code

 8). Ruby END Statement :-
	Syntax :- 
		END {
		   code
		}
		
	eg :- 
	 code :- puts "main code"
		END{
		    puts "Always run at the end of code"
		}
		BEGIN{
		    puts "priority code"
		}
		
	output :- priority code
		  main code
		  Always run at the end of code
		  
 9). Ruby Comments :-
	-> A comment hides a line, part of a line, or several lines from the Ruby interpreter. 
	-> You can use the hash character (#) at the beginning of a line 

		eg :- # I am a comment. Just ignore me.
		
		   :- =begin
		      This is a comment.
		      This is a comment, too.
		      This is a comment, too.
		      I said that already.
		      =end
