-------------------------------------------------------------VARIABLES-------------------------------------------------------------------

 1). Local Variables    -> Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _.

 2). Instance Variables −> Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. 
			-> Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.
			    
			    	eg:- @cust_id = id
	NOTE:-		    	  :- puts "Customer id #@cust_id"    

 3). Class Variables    −> Class variables are available across different objects.
			-> They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.
			    
			    	eg:- class Customer
   				        @@no_of_customers = 0
				     end

 4). Global Variables   −> Class variables are not available across classes. 
        	       -> If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, 
        	       -> you need to define a global variable. 
        	       -> The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).
        	    
	        	    	eg :- $global_variable = 10

 5). Ruby Pseudo-Variables :-
  
  -> They are special variables that have the appearance of local variables but behave like constants.
  -> You cannot assign any value to these variables.

	a). self     − The receiver object of the current method.
	b). true     − Value representing true.
	c). false    − Value representing false.
	d). nil      − Value representing undefined.
	e). __FILE__ − The name of the current source file.
	f). __LINE__ − The current line number in the source file.
	
 6). Ruby Basic Literals :-
 
 	a). Integer Numbers  :- range from -2^30 to (2^30)-1 or -2^62 to (2^62)-1.
 	b). Floating Numbers :- Ruby supports floating numbers. They are also numbers but with decimals.
 	c). String Literals  :- Ruby strings are simply sequences of 8-bit bytes and they are objects of class String. 
 			      :- Double-quoted strings allow substitution and backslash notation 
 			      :- but single-quoted strings don't allow substitution and allow backslash notation only for \\ and \'
 			      
 		eg :-   puts 'escape using "\\"';
			puts 'That\'s right';
			
			output :-
				escape using "\"
				That's right
			 	
 NOTE IMP :- You can substitute the value of any Ruby expression into a string using the sequence #{ expr }.
 
 7). Ruby Arrays :-
 
 -> Literals of Ruby Array are created by placing a comma-separated series of object references between the square brackets. 
 -> A trailing comma is ignored.

   eg :-
	ary = [  "fred", 10, 3.14, "This is a string", "last element", ]
	ary.each do |i|
	   puts i
	end

   output :-
	fred
	10
	3.14
	This is a string
	last element
	
 8). Ruby Hashes
  -> A literal Ruby Hash is created by placing a list of key/value pairs between braces, with either a comma or the sequence => between the key and the value. 
  -> A trailing comma is ignored.

	eg :- 
		hsh = colors = { "red" => 0xf00, "green" => 0x0f0, "blue" => 0x00f }
		hsh.each do |key, value|
		   print key, " is ", value, "\n"
		end

	output :-
		red is 3840
		green is 240
		blue is 15

 9). Ruby Ranges
  -> A range (1..5) means it includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 values 
  -> A range (1...5) means it includes 1, 2, 3, 4 values.
  
	eg:-
		(10..15).each do |n| 
		   print n, ' ' 
		end
		
	output :-
		10 11 12 13 14 15
